# Log for Task 7: Agent Metadata as Markdown

This log summarizes the steps taken to complete the seventh task from `TASKS.md`.

## Summary of Actions

1. **Task Analysis**: Started Task 7, "Agent Metadata as Markdown" with requirements for storing/editing agent, role, and skill metadata in markdown with frontmatter, editable via CLI or text editor, using `.arcane/agents/` structure.

2. **Enhanced Metadata Architecture Design**:
   - Created `MetadataManager` class (`packages/core/src/agents/metadata.ts`)
   - Designed directory-based organization with individual metadata files:
     - `~/.arcane/agents/[name]/meta.md` - Agent metadata with YAML frontmatter
     - `~/.arcane/agents/[name]/agent.md` - Main content referencing meta.md
     - Similar structure for roles and skills in their respective directories
   - Implemented rich markdown generation with comprehensive documentation

3. **Metadata File System Operations**:
   - Built comprehensive file operations for metadata management
   - Added support for creating, reading, updating, and listing metadata files
   - Implemented frontmatter parsing and YAML generation utilities
   - Added ecosystem rebuilding from metadata files for data consistency
   - Support for slugified directory names and cross-references

4. **CLI Edit Command System**:
   - Created comprehensive edit command (`packages/cli/src/commands/editCommand.ts`)
   - Implemented multiple editing modes:
     - **Text Editor Mode**: Open metadata files in external text editor ($EDITOR)
     - **Field Edit Mode**: Direct field updates via command line
     - **Interactive Mode**: Guided prompts for editing (framework included)
     - **Validation Mode**: Optional validation after editing
   - Added support for nested field editing with dot notation

5. **CLI Commands Implemented**:

   ```bash
   # Text editor editing
   gemini edit agent "Developer Bot"
   gemini edit agent "Developer Bot" --editor vim

   # Field-specific editing
   gemini edit agent "Developer Bot" --field enabled --value false
   gemini edit agent "Developer Bot" --field roles --value '["developer", "reviewer"]'

   # Interactive editing
   gemini edit role "Code Reviewer" --interactive

   # Validation
   gemini edit skill "Programming" --field level --value advanced --validate
   ```

6. **Enhanced Directory Structure**:
   - Individual directories for each agent, role, and skill
   - Separate metadata files with rich YAML frontmatter
   - Main content files that reference metadata files
   - Cross-linking between files for easy navigation
   - Human-readable and editable format

7. **Metadata File Generation**:
   - Rich markdown files with comprehensive YAML frontmatter containing all metadata
   - Structured content sections with:
     - Metadata descriptions and configuration notes
     - Field documentation with explanations
     - CLI command references for editing
     - Timestamp tracking and version information
   - Main content files that reference and summarize metadata

8. **Integration with Existing System**:
   - Extended `AgentManager` to use `MetadataManager` for enhanced operations
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing ecosystem.json
   - Added metadata loading prioritization (meta.md files take precedence)
   - Integrated with CLI argument parsing and command routing
   - Added usage statistics tracking for edit commands

9. **Advanced Features**:
   - **Frontmatter Parsing**: Custom YAML parser for metadata extraction
   - **Field Validation**: Type-aware field editing with JSON parsing
   - **File Timestamps**: Automatic update tracking with ISO timestamps
   - **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed metadata files
   - **Ecosystem Sync**: Rebuilding ecosystem from metadata files
   - **Editor Integration**: Support for external text editors with environment variables

10. **Comprehensive Testing**:
    - Created extensive test suite (`packages/core/src/agents/metadata.test.ts`)
    - 15 test cases covering all functionality including edge cases
    - Mocked file system operations for reliable testing
    - Tests for directory creation, metadata loading, updating, and validation
    - YAML parsing and generation tests

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Directory-Based Organization

- Individual directories for each agent/role/skill with organized structure
- Separate metadata files with rich YAML frontmatter
- Main content files that reference metadata for easy navigation
- Slugified directory names for file system compatibility

### ✅ CLI Metadata Editing

- Text editor integration with $EDITOR environment variable support
- Field-specific editing with dot notation for nested properties
- Interactive editing framework with guided prompts
- Validation and error handling for metadata consistency

### ✅ Rich Markdown Generation

- Comprehensive YAML frontmatter with all metadata fields
- Structured content sections with documentation and examples
- CLI command references embedded in metadata files
- Cross-linking between metadata and content files

### ✅ Metadata Loading and Management

- Priority loading from meta.md files over ecosystem.json
- Ecosystem rebuilding from distributed metadata files
- File listing and metadata extraction utilities
- Update tracking with automatic timestamps

### ✅ Advanced File Operations

- Custom YAML parsing and generation for frontmatter
- Error handling for malformed metadata files
- File system operations with proper error recovery
- Directory creation and management

## Technical Architecture

The enhanced metadata system follows a sophisticated, file-based architecture:

1. **Metadata Storage Layer** (`metadata.ts`)
   - Directory-based organization with individual metadata files
   - Rich YAML frontmatter with comprehensive field documentation
   - File system operations with error handling and validation

2. **Integration Layer** (Enhanced `manager.ts`)
   - Seamless integration with existing agent management system
   - Priority loading from metadata files with ecosystem fallback
   - Backward compatibility with existing data structures

3. **CLI Interface Layer** (`editCommand.ts`)
   - Multiple editing modes (editor, field, interactive)
   - Command-line argument parsing and validation
   - Integration with external text editors and environment

4. **File Format Layer**
   - Custom YAML parsing for frontmatter extraction
   - Structured markdown generation with documentation
   - Cross-references and navigation aids
