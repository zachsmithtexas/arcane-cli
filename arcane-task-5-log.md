# Log for Task 5: Track Usage Stats & Provider Failures

This log summarizes the steps taken to complete the fifth task from `TASKS.md`.

## Summary of Actions

1. **Task Analysis**: Started Task 5, "Track Usage Stats & Provider Failures" with requirements for anonymized tracking of command frequency and provider success/failures with local storage and opt-out capabilities.

2. **Core Usage Statistics System**:
   - Created comprehensive `UsageStatsManager` class (`packages/core/src/telemetry/usageStats.ts`)
   - Implemented structured data schemas using Zod for validation:
     - `ProviderStats` - Success rates, response times, failure breakdowns by reason
     - `CommandStats` - Usage counts, execution times, success/failure rates
     - `SessionStats` - Session duration, commands executed, tokens used
   - Added configurable anonymization with privacy-preserving transformations
   - Implemented local JSON file storage in `~/.arcane/usage-stats.json`

3. **Provider Integration**:
   - Extended `ProviderManager` to track all provider usage and failures
   - Integrated with existing key rotation system to track rotation events
   - Added response time measurement and failure reason categorization
   - Connected usage stats to provider fallback logic

4. **CLI Session Management**:
   - Added session lifecycle tracking to main CLI entry point
   - Implemented automatic session start/end tracking with cleanup handlers
   - Added command execution time tracking with success/failure recording
   - Integrated gracefully with existing error handling

5. **Comprehensive CLI Commands**:
   - Extended provider command system with `stats` subcommands:
     - `gemini provider stats summary` - High-level usage overview
     - `gemini provider stats providers` - Provider reliability and performance metrics
     - `gemini provider stats commands` - Command usage patterns and execution times
     - `gemini provider stats sessions` - Recent session details and history
     - `gemini provider stats export <path>` - Export data to JSON file
     - `gemini provider stats clear --clear` - Clear all statistics
   - Added rich console output with emojis, success rate indicators, and timestamps

6. **Data Management Features**:
   - Configurable data retention periods (default 30 days)
   - Session history limits (default 100 sessions)
   - Automatic cleanup of old data
   - Export functionality for analysis
   - Complete data clearing for privacy

7. **Testing & Quality**:
   - Created comprehensive test suite (`packages/core/src/telemetry/usageStats.test.ts`)
   - 32 test cases covering all functionality including edge cases
   - Mocked file system operations for reliable testing
   - Tests for anonymization, error handling, and data persistence

8. **Privacy & Configuration**:
   - Built-in anonymization of sensitive data (session IDs, custom providers, command arguments)
   - Configurable opt-out system
   - Anonymous installation IDs for aggregation without tracking
   - Safe handling of API keys and user data

## Key Features Implemented

### âœ… Anonymized Command Frequency Tracking

- Tracks all CLI commands with execution times and success rates
- Anonymizes command arguments while preserving usage patterns
- Running averages for performance metrics

### âœ… Provider Success/Failure Tracking

- Comprehensive failure categorization (rate limits, invalid keys, network errors)
- Response time tracking and reliability metrics
- Integration with key rotation events
- Provider performance comparisons

### âœ… Local Storage with Opt-out

- JSON file storage in user home directory
- Configurable enabling/disabling of tracking
- Data retention policies and automatic cleanup
- Export functionality for user control

### âœ… Rich CLI Interface

- Intuitive stats viewing commands with formatted output
- Visual indicators for success rates (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´)
- Detailed breakdowns by provider, command, and session
- Export and clear functionality

### âœ… Session Analytics

- Session duration and activity tracking
- Token usage monitoring across providers
- Tool call execution statistics
- Recent session history with filtering

## Technical Architecture

The implementation follows a layered, privacy-first architecture:

1. **Data Collection Layer** (`UsageStatsManager`)
   - Structured data collection with Zod validation
   - Configurable anonymization and privacy controls
   - Automatic data lifecycle management

2. **Integration Layer** (Provider/CLI integration)
   - Seamless integration with existing telemetry infrastructure
   - Provider system hooks for automatic tracking
   - CLI lifecycle event handling

3. **Storage Layer** (JSON file system)
   - Local file storage with error handling
   - Configurable retention and cleanup policies
   - Export/import capabilities

4. **Interface Layer** (CLI commands)
   - Rich, user-friendly command interface
   - Multiple view formats (summary, detailed, export)
   - Privacy controls and data management

## Privacy and Compliance

- **Anonymization**: Session IDs, custom provider names, and command arguments are anonymized
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally, no external transmission
- **Opt-out**: Complete disable capability with `setEnabled(false)`
- **Data Control**: Users can export, view, and clear all data
- **Transparency**: Full visibility into what data is collected

## Task Completion Status

âœ… **Anonymized tracking**: Command frequency, execution times, and provider usage  
âœ… **Provider success/failures**: Comprehensive failure tracking with categorization  
âœ… **Local storage**: JSON file storage with configurable retention  
âœ… **Opt-out available**: Complete control over data collection  
âœ… **Toggleable**: Can be enabled/disabled at runtime

The usage statistics and provider failure tracking system is now fully implemented, providing comprehensive insights while maintaining user privacy and control. The system integrates seamlessly with existing functionality and provides valuable analytics for improving the CLI experience.
