# Log for Task 6: Scripted Agent/Role/Skill Generation

This log summarizes the steps taken to complete the sixth task from `TASKS.md`.

## Summary of Actions

1. **Task Analysis**: Started Task 6, "Scripted Agent/Role/Skill Generation" with requirements for CLI scripts to generate agents, roles, and skills with guided prompts, markdown scaffolding, fuzzy search, and `.arcane/` directory structure.

2. **Agent Ecosystem Architecture Design**:
   - Created comprehensive type system (`packages/core/src/agents/types.ts`)
   - Designed structured data schemas using Zod validation:
     - `Agent` - AI agents with personality, instructions, roles, skills, tools, and model configuration
     - `Role` - Role definitions with responsibilities, required/optional skills, permissions, and restrictions
     - `Skill` - Skill definitions with levels, prerequisites, tools, examples, and categories
   - Added priority levels, versioning, metadata, and tagging systems
   - Implemented validation interfaces with errors, warnings, and suggestions

3. **Agent Management System**:
   - Built comprehensive `AgentManager` class (`packages/core/src/agents/manager.ts`)
   - Implemented file system operations with `.arcane/` directory structure:
     - `~/.arcane/agents/` - Agent markdown files
     - `~/.arcane/roles/` - Role markdown files
     - `~/.arcane/skills/` - Skill markdown files
     - `~/.arcane/ecosystem.json` - Centralized metadata tracking
   - Added fuzzy search functionality across all entity types
   - Implemented list, search, create, validate, and management operations
   - Built markdown file generation with YAML frontmatter and rich content

4. **Interactive Generation System**:
   - Created `InteractiveGenerator` class (`packages/core/src/agents/generator.ts`)
   - Implemented guided prompts for all entity types:
     - Agent generation: name, description, personality, instructions, model config, roles, skills, tools
     - Role generation: name, description, responsibilities, skills, permissions, restrictions
     - Skill generation: name, description, level, category, prerequisites, tools, examples
   - Added template system with predefined configurations:
     - Agent templates: developer, analyst, writer, researcher
     - Role templates: project-manager, code-reviewer, technical-writer
     - Skill templates: programming, data-analysis, technical-writing, code-review

5. **CLI Command Integration**:
   - Built comprehensive CLI command (`packages/cli/src/commands/generateCommand.ts`)
   - Added command-line argument parsing and validation
   - Implemented multiple generation modes:
     - Interactive mode with guided prompts (default)
     - Non-interactive mode with templates and direct input
     - List mode for viewing existing entities
     - Search mode with fuzzy matching
     - Dry-run mode for previewing without creating files
   - Added output directory customization and overwrite protection

6. **CLI Commands Implemented**:

   ```bash
   # Interactive generation
   gemini generate agent
   gemini generate role
   gemini generate skill

   # Template-based generation
   gemini generate agent --name "MyBot" --template developer
   gemini generate role --name "Reviewer" --template code-reviewer

   # List and search
   gemini generate agent --list
   gemini generate skill --search "programming"

   # Advanced options
   gemini generate agent --dry-run --output ./custom-dir
   gemini generate role --overwrite
   ```

7. **Directory Structure Implementation**:
   - Automatic `.arcane/` directory creation in user home
   - Organized subdirectories for each entity type
   - Markdown files with slugified names (`my-agent.md`)
   - JSON ecosystem file for centralized tracking and search indexing
   - Support for custom output directories

8. **Markdown File Generation**:
   - Rich markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing all metadata
   - Structured content sections:
     - Agent files: personality, instructions, roles, skills, tools, configuration
     - Role files: responsibilities, required/optional skills, permissions, restrictions
     - Skill files: level, category, prerequisites, tools, examples, restrictions
   - Automatic timestamps, versioning, and tag support
   - Human-readable format suitable for editing

9. **Validation and Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive validation with Zod schemas
   - Context-aware error messages, warnings, and suggestions
   - Validation for names, descriptions, relationships, and constraints
   - Overwrite protection with explicit confirmation required
   - Graceful error handling with helpful error messages

10. **Comprehensive Testing**:
    - Created extensive test suites for both manager and generator
    - 32 test cases covering all functionality including edge cases
    - Mocked file system operations for reliable testing
    - Tests for validation, error handling, search, list, and generation
    - Both unit tests and integration tests

11. **Integration and Usage Tracking**:
    - Integrated with main CLI with proper command routing
    - Added usage statistics tracking for all generate commands
    - Exported agent system from core package for external use
    - Enhanced CLI configuration with new command arguments
    - Proper error handling and user feedback
