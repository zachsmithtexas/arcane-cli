Summary of the Log & Where Gemini Was Interrupted
Overall Context
This log is for an AI coding session with Gemini CLI that resumed after a previous interruption (API quota, crash, etc).

It includes instructions for handling tasks in TASKS.md one at a time, requiring explicit user approval before moving to the next, and for detailed git hygiene (show files, ask for commit message, summarize, etc).

What Gemini Was Doing

1. Loaded Context and Identified the Next Task:

Last completed task: Agent Metadata as Markdown (#7)

Next task: “Dynamic Capability/Restriction by Role/Skill”

Enforce agent capabilities dynamically based on assigned roles and skills (via their meta.md files)

This must update live, not require restart, and override tools as necessary.

2. Proposed & Got Approval for an Implementation Plan:

Analyze existing agent/tool logic (manager.ts, metadata.ts)

Implement a function to resolve capabilities by:

Fetching all allowed/restricted tools from agent, role, and skill metadata

Calculating a final set (additive, minus any restrictions)

Enforcing this set dynamically, always checking the latest metadata

Add tests for the new system

3. Stepped Through the Implementation (Atomic Commits/Edits):

Analyzed current files and explained the structure

Updated the TypeScript interfaces for Role and Skill to replace permissions/restrictions with explicit allowedTools and restrictedTools

Refactored code in multiple files to use the new names

Wrote a new getAgentCapabilities function that:

Combines all allowed tools from agent/roles/skills, then subtracts restricted tools

Created a new test suite (capabilities.test.ts) to check different scenarios (conflicts, combinations, etc)

4. Ran the Tests:

First test run failed with a syntax error caused by backticks (`) in the documentation markdown breaking esbuild

Fixed this by replacing backticks with single quotes in generated markdown/docstrings

Reran tests, and reduced the number of failures (just two failed suites at last point)

Where Gemini Got Cut Off
Gemini CLI was interrupted by an API quota error after a long session of edits and running tests.

The specific error was a 429 (“RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED”) from Google’s Gemini API:
“You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details…”

At the time of cutoff:

All refactoring to enable dynamic agent capabilities/restrictions had been done

Code and tests were in place

There was still one or two test failures (not yet resolved in the log)

What To Do Next
Pick up at the point where you reran the tests.

Review the remaining test failures (in capabilities.test.ts and manager.test.ts)—most likely these are minor bugs or edge cases due to the refactor.

If tests pass, the feature is basically ready!

If tests fail, check error output (it was truncated, so you may need to re-run to see all errors).
