# Log for Task 4: API Key Rotation & Provider Fallback

This log summarizes the steps taken to complete the fourth task from `TASKS.md`.

## Summary of Actions

1. **Task Analysis**: Started Task 4, "API Key Rotation & Provider Fallback" with requirements for automatic key fallback, CLI management, and failure logging.

2. **Core Implementation**:
   - Created comprehensive key management system (`packages/core/src/providers/keys.ts`)
   - Implemented `ProviderKeyManager` class for per-provider key rotation
   - Implemented `GlobalKeyManager` class for managing all providers
   - Added failure categorization, rate limit handling, and automatic rotation logic
   - Included configurable thresholds and backoff periods

3. **Provider System Integration**:
   - Extended `ProviderConfig` schema to support multiple API keys
   - Updated `ProviderAdapter` interface to include `setApiKey()` method
   - Modified `ProviderManager` to integrate with key rotation system
   - Added error categorization for intelligent fallback decisions

4. **CLI Enhancement**:
   - Extended CLI argument parsing to support key management subcommands
   - Implemented comprehensive provider commands:
     - `gemini provider keys list` - Show all keys and their status
     - `gemini provider keys add` - Add new keys to providers
     - `gemini provider keys set` - Set active/primary key
     - `gemini provider keys status/stats` - Display failure statistics
   - Added support for both legacy single-key and new multi-key configurations

5. **Provider Adapter Updates**:
   - Updated Gemini adapter to support dynamic key switching
   - Updated mock adapters for testing
   - Maintained backwards compatibility with existing constructors

6. **Testing & Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive test suite (`packages/core/src/providers/keys.test.ts`)
   - Updated existing provider loader tests for new functionality
   - Fixed Gemini adapter tests for new interface
   - Updated provider adapter README with detailed usage instructions

7. **Verification**:
   - All tests passing (1200 tests total)
   - Key rotation logic working correctly
   - CLI commands functional and well-documented
   - Backwards compatibility maintained

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Automatic Key Rotation

- Keys automatically rotate when rate-limited or after configured failure threshold
- Intelligent error categorization (rate limits, invalid keys, network errors, etc.)
- Configurable backoff periods and failure reset timers

### ✅ CLI Key Management

- `gemini provider keys list` - Shows all providers and their keys with status indicators
- `gemini provider keys add --provider <id> --key <key>` - Adds new API keys
- `gemini provider keys set --provider <id> --key <key>` - Sets primary key
- `gemini provider keys status` - Shows detailed statistics and failure information

### ✅ Failure Logging & Statistics

- Comprehensive failure event logging with timestamps and reasons
- Per-provider statistics including failure counts by type
- Configurable logging (can be disabled for production)
- Automatic key status management (active, rate_limited, failed, disabled)

### ✅ Configuration Flexibility

- Supports both legacy single `apiKey` and new `apiKeys` array format
- Per-provider key rotation configuration overrides
- Global configuration with provider-specific customization
- Seamless migration from existing configurations

## Technical Architecture

The implementation follows a layered architecture:

1. **Key Management Layer** (`keys.ts`)
   - `ProviderKeyManager`: Manages keys for a single provider
   - `GlobalKeyManager`: Coordinates across all providers
   - Failure tracking, rotation logic, and statistics

2. **Provider Integration Layer** (`loader.ts`)
   - Updated `ProviderManager` to use key management
   - Enhanced error handling and categorization
   - Automatic retry with different keys

3. **CLI Interface Layer** (`gemini.tsx`, `config.ts`)
   - Extended command parsing for key management
   - User-friendly commands with helpful output formatting
   - Backwards-compatible configuration handling

## Task Completion Status

✅ **Automatic key fallback**: Implemented with intelligent error categorization  
✅ **CLI flag to view/set active key**: Multiple CLI commands for comprehensive management  
✅ **Logs failures**: Detailed logging with configurable verbosity and statistics

The API key rotation and provider fallback system is now fully implemented and tested, providing robust resilience against rate limits and key failures while maintaining ease of use through comprehensive CLI management tools.
