# Log for Task 1: Provider Modularity & API Management

This log summarizes the steps taken to complete the first task from `TASKS.md`.

## Summary of Actions

1.  **Initialization**: Received `TASKS.md` and a research zip file. Began work on Task 1: "Implement Provider Plugin Loader".
2.  **Code Exploration**: Investigated the existing `packages/core/src/providers` directory and found a `loader.ts` file to build upon.
3.  **Implementation & Testing**:
    *   Created mock provider adapters (`mock.ts`, `mock2.ts`) for robust testing.
    *   Wrote a comprehensive test suite (`loader.test.ts`) using `vitest`.
    *   Debugged and resolved several test environment issues, including `vitest` command failures and module mocking problems.
    *   Implemented the `generateContentWithFallback` method to handle provider failures gracefully.
    *   Implemented the `reloadConfig` method to support hot-swapping of provider configurations.
4.  **Task Completion**:
    *   Verified all criteria for Task 1 were met.
    *   Marked the task as complete in `TASKS.md`.
5.  **Version Control**:
    *   Staged all new and modified files.
    *   Drafted and received approval for a detailed commit message.
    *   Successfully committed the changes.
    *   Attempted to push to `origin/main`, but encountered a git authentication error. After you resolved the configuration, the push was successful.
6.  **Cleanup**: Removed temporary research files.

The provider loader is now feature-complete as per the task requirements.
